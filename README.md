# Static CV Webage

This project was an overhaul of another static CV webpage that I made during my coding bootcamp. I wanted to include more media within my webpage to better depict the type of person that I am. This project will be updated frequently as I learn more html, css, bootstrap, javascript and as I learn new languages. 

* ## Comments

I have played around with the layout of the page but feel that there is something missing. I want the buttons, margin sizes, etc to be consistent across the webpage as it looks a bit off in many places. I also think that the projects and education sections could be laid out in a better manner. As far as additions, I do not think there is much I could add. 

* ## Issues and Planned Future Functionality 

Presently, when any of the books are hovered over, their title is displayed. This is from goodreads.com's own code, however, the titles are small and take a few seconds to display. I wish to display the titles in clearer text instantly when a book is hovered over. Additionally, to make the dropdown content more discernable, I will add an arrow next to dropdown elements, I think this can be done by selecting a specific button class from bootstrap. The dropdown content takes up a lot of space as well, so it would be optimal if the user clicks on one, any other collapsible content disappears. Lastly,in the about me section, I would like the spotify and the chess embeded elements to be more personal. The image of me is cropped incorrectly. I also need to add GIFs (or something else) of Scotland Yard, Game of Life and Medic Recall - as I tried to add videos but forgot about the file size limit on github.

* ## Installation and Usage

At the moment, I have not dockerised this project. The user simply needs to go to the github pages link to access this project. https://tinayesc.github.io/CV/
