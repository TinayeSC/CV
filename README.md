# Static CV Webage

This project was an overhaul of another static CV webpage that I made during my coding bootcamp. I wanted to include more media within my webpage to better depict the type of person that I am. This project will be updated frequently as I learn more html, css, bootstrap, and when I begin to learn java. 

* ## Functionality

Some functionality of this webpage is hard to discern on first glance. This is due to the contraints of my html and css knowledge, as well as aesthetic choices. Firstly, this README.md file, as well as this project's repository can be accesed by clicking the two emboldened and underlined words in the bio at the top of the page. Additionally, @sirpauldouglas' instagram page, Harare International School, University of Bristol, University of Edinburgh, HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp (in the "Education" table),  the about me button at the bottom of the page, all the essay titles, and all the books will produce some form of dropdown or redirection to a new page in a new tab upon clicking them. 

* ## Issues and Planned Future Functionality 

Presently, when any of the books are hovered over, their title is displayed. This is from goodreads.com's own code, however, the titles are small and take a few seconds to display. I wish to display the titles in clearer text instantly when a book is hovered over. Additionally, to make the dropdown content more discernable, I will add an arrow next to dropdown elements, I think this can be done by selecting a specific button class from bootstrap. The dropdown content takes up a lot of space as well, so it would be optimal that if the user clicks on one, any other collapsible content disappears. Lastly,in the about me section, I would like the spotify and the chess embeded elements to be more personal. I am not sure if I can embed my own listening profile, or chess.com profile as an iframe, but I would prefer to do that than to display the most recent episode of the two podcasts. 

* ## Installation and Usage

At the moment, I have not dockerised this project. The user simply needs to go to the github pages link to access this project. https://tinayesc.github.io/CV/
