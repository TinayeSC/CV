          <p>Thank you for taking time to look at my webpage! I have broad interests but get very
            involved and hands with whatever is right in front og me. From my reading I derived this ethos
            which is similair to existentialism. I believe that all man has is their actions, any type of purporse
            is nonexistent... I enjoy reading and writting. I am currently in the process of setting up a blog page,
            but for the time being, please have a look at some of the essays I have written in the past.
