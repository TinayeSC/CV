          <p>Thank you for taking time to look at my webpage! I have broad interests but get very
            involved and hands with whatever is right in front og me. From my reading I derived this ethos
            which is similair to existentialism. I believe that all man has is their actions, any type of purporse
            is nonexistent... I enjoy reading and writting. I am currently in the process of setting up a blog page,
            but for the time being, please have a look at some of the essays I have written in the past.

    <h4 >Harare International School</h4>
        <p> During my time studying the IB Diploma programme, I ... For my final 2 years
          I took <b>Chemistry, Language and Literature</b>, and <b> Business Management at Higher Level</b>; 
          with <b>Environmental Systems and Societies, Mathematics</b>, and <b>Spanish at Standard Level</b>. Along
          with TOK, the Extended Essay, Creativity Action Service, and all my IAs; I passed everything. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>At HIS I enjoyed a range of Extra Curricular activities which helped develop me as a person. I attended multiple International Schools of Southen and Eastern Africa 
          (ISSEA) sports tournaments and events. I was a part of the Senior Varsity Basketball team for 
          3 years and was the Team Captain in my final year. Additionally, I attended a Track and Field ISSEA 
          where I ran the 3km, 5km and 1.6km races and competed in the Javelin throw. Lastly, I performed at a Art and Drama 
          ISSEA event. Through partaking in all these tournaments and events, I met numerous people 
          from the international community and got to visit Lusaka, Addis Abbaba, Kampala, and Johanesburg. 
          These events taught me how to be a part of, and how to lead a team in both triumph and failure.

  <h4>University of Bristol</h4>
  <p>At Bristol I studied a 1 year Foundation Programme in STEM. I passed all modules with results in the top half of my cohort.
    The modules comprised of Foundations of Physics, Mathematics for STEM, Accelerated Academic Language and Literacy, and Language and 
    Communications. After passing with adequate results, I progressed onto Aerospace Engineering (MEng). The first year 
    comprised of Engineering Mathematics, Fundamentals of Aerospace, Engineering by Design, and Engineering by Investigation. 
    Unfortunately, I was not mentally healthy enough to succesffuly study on this course. I was given a validated Extenuating Circumstances
    but it was too late in the year for me to be re-enrolled on a repeat year. Although the year was difficult, I still felt that i learnt a few 
    key engineering princples and it helped me to visualise my career path. 

    At the University of Bristol, I was heavily involved with the Dog Society which I will disucss later.
