<!--Seperate education into sections and add relevant photos or iframes afterwars.
e.g for HIS add ISSEA photos and other things like projects maybe. For Bristol add Dog Soc
For Bootcamp add one of your projects or just say this website is an example of blah-->

      <h4 >Harare International School</h4>
          <p> During my time studying the IB Diploma programme,
            I took <b>Chemistry, Language and Literature</b>, and <b> Business Management at Higher Level</b>; 
            with <b>Environmental Systems and Societies, Mathematics</b>, and <b>Spanish at Standard Level</b>. Along
            with TOK, the Extended Essay, Creativity Action Service, and all my IAs; I passed everything. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>At HIS I enjoyed a range of Extra Curricular activities which helped develop me as a person. I attended multiple International Schools of Southen and Eastern Africa 
            (ISSEA) sports tournaments and events. I was a part of the Senior Varsity Basketball team for 
            3 years and was the Team Captain in my final year. Additionally, I attended a Track and Field ISSEA 
            where I ran the 3km, 5km and 1.6km races and competed in the Javelin throw. Lastly, I performed at a Art and Drama 
            ISSEA event. Through partaking in all these tournaments and events, I met numerous people 
            from the international community and got to visit Lusaka, Addis Abbaba, Kampala, and Johanesburg. 
            These events taught me how to be a part of, and how to lead a team in both triumph and failure.

      <h4>University of Bristol</h4>
      <p>At Bristol I studied a 1 year Foundation Programme in STEM. I passed all modules with results in the top half of my cohort.
        The modules comprised of Foundations of Physics, Mathematics for STEM, Accelerated Academic Language and Literacy, and Language and 
        Communications. After passing with adequate results, I progressed onto Aerospace Engineering (MEng). The first year 
        comprised of Engineering Mathematics, Fundamentals of Aerospace, Engineering by Design, and Engineering by Investigation. 
        Unfortunately, I was not mentally healthy enough to succesffuly study on this course. I was given a validated Extenuating Circumstances
        but it was too late in the year for me to be re-enrolled on a repeat year. Although the year was difficult, I still felt that i learnt a few 
        key engineering princples and it helped me to visualise my career path. 

        At the University of Bristol, I was heavily involved with the Dog Society which I will disucss later.

      <p>Due to my academic situation, I have been spending most of 2022 and 2023 learning new skills 
      and trying to become a better person in as many ways as I can. This has involved reading more this year than last.
      My favourite genre's are philosphy and sci-fi, although I have recently become very interested 
      in ancient and African history. In additon, I have started playing Chess again. When I was younger, I taught myself
      how to play with my grandmother's computer and was one of the best players at our school. I wish to further my game and 
      possibly play in competitve tournaments this year. To realise this goal, I will also be adding add Chess Theory to my books to read 
      this year. 
      <br><br>
      In addition to getting more involved with Chess, I have also restarted running and varying the type of running I do. 
      I ran the 10km Spitfire race in 2022 at the RAF Museum; afterwhich I did not run for months. I ran two unprofessional half marathons in 2022 and 
      2021 and with my varied training I hope to complete a full marathon by the end of this year, and I will try to beat my time 
      for this year's Spitfire race. 
      <br><br>
      I have both physical and mental goals, and I believe that podcasts help me to achieve both. The Andrew Huberman podcast
      has taught me many protocols that have improved my sleep and helped me to plan out how to train without burning out or 
      not fueling properly, which I had severe issues with in the past. Additionally, I find that podcasts are my preffered method 
      of recieving information. Dan Carlin's Hardcore History has been an invaluable source in conceptualising the first blog 
      post in which I will be releasing later this year. 
      <br><br>
      I am very aware of Arthur Schaupenhauer's quote that "if a young man achieved all he planned to, he 
      would die prematurely from stress.". I have a lot planned, but I have already started every project. 
      My plan is to progess slowly. This way I am sure to complete many of my goals this year. 
      <br><br>

      Lastly, I would like to list a few more of my likes and hobbies: brazillian jiu jitsu, MMA, football/soccer,
      stand up comedy, NBA, fishing, cinema going, weight lifting, writting, reflective journaling, gaming, making gaming montages,
      self improvement, meditation, walking dogs, music, running new routes, among others.  </p>
