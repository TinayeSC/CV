    <p style = "line-height: 50px;"  >I grew up in Zimbabwe, which provided me with many life lessons and a valuable perspective on the privileges 
      I have been afforded. I am currently in my second year of studying Computer Science at the University of Bristol, after a few 
      years of overcoming the challenges of adjusting to life in a new country. I am now confident in my ability to navigate a workplace and 
      learn new topics quickly. At present, I aspire to specialize in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, and possibly Advanced 
      Algorithms.  </p>

        <p>I studied the <b>International Baccalaureate</b> programme whilst fully engaging in extra-curricular
          activities. The subjects I took were, Chemistry, Spanish, Mathematics, Language and Literature, Business Management, Environmental Systems and Societies and Theory of Knowledege. 
          Two notable achievements were my captaincy of the varisty basketball team in my senior year and being awarded the presidential academic 
        excellence and achievement certificates in all years of study.

  <h4>2022-2023</h4>
  <p> This <b>Software Engineering </b> Bootcamp was in collaboration with HyperionDev. It comprised of three sections: Intro to Programming, Introduction to Software 
    Engineering and Advanced Software Engineering. I finished with the highest average grade out of all the 259 students in my class. This bootcamp was very useful 
    for my tranistion into Computer Science as I have already had an introduction to many of the programming units.

  <h4 >2023-Present</h4>
  <p>I began studying <b>Computer Science</b> (MEng) in September 2023. Being one of the oldest students 
  in my cohort, I enjoy giving my coursemates advice on how to manage University life; whilst I continue to learn 
myself. Although I have had a difficult start and still find myself making past mistakes, I feel very secure in this choice 
of study. I look forward to making a positive change in the world. "When we write computer code, we aren't just designing a product. We 
are redesigning politics, society and culture, and so we had better have a good grasp of politics, society and culture." - Yuval Noah Harari </p>

<!--Seperate education into sections and add relevant photos or iframes afterwars.
e.g for HIS add ISSEA photos and other things like projects maybe. For Bristol add Dog Soc
For Bootcamp add one of your projects or just say this website is an example of blah-->

      <h4 >Harare International School</h4>
          <p> During my time studying the IB Diploma programme,
            I took <b>Chemistry, Language and Literature</b>, and <b> Business Management at Higher Level</b>; 
            with <b>Environmental Systems and Societies, Mathematics</b>, and <b>Spanish at Standard Level</b>. Along
            with Theory of Knowledge, the Extended Essay, Creativity Action Service, and all my IAs; I passed everything. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>At HIS I enjoyed a range of Extra Curricular activities which helped develop me as a person. I attended multiple International Schools of Southen and Eastern Africa 
            (ISSEA) sports tournaments and events. I was a part of the Senior Varsity Basketball team for 
            3 years and was the Team Captain in my final year. Additionally, I attended a Track and Field ISSEA 
            where I ran the 3km, 5km and 1.6km races and competed in the Javelin throw. Lastly, I performed at a Art and Drama 
            ISSEA event. Through participating in all these tournaments and events, I met numerous people 
            from the international community and got to visit Lusaka, Addis Abbaba, Kampala, and Johanesburg. 
            These events taught me how to be a part of, and how to lead a team in both triumph and failure.

      <p>
        The modules of the IFP comprised of Foundations of Physics, Mathematics for STEM, Accelerated Academic Language and Literacy, and Language and 
        Communications. I am proud of my steady increase of proficiency in mathematics during the course. I got 60% on the mid term exam and managed 
        to get 88% on the final exam. After passing the IFP, I progressed onto Aerospace Engineering (MEng). The first year 
        comprised of Engineering Mathematics, Fundamentals of Aerospace, Engineering by Design, and Engineering by Investigation. 
        Unfortunately, I was not mentally healthy enough to succesffuly study on this course. Extenuating Circumstances were validated 
        but it was too late in the year for me to be re-enrolled on a repeat year. Although the year was difficult, I still felt that i learnt a few 
        key engineering princples and it helped me to visualise my career path. This gave me the oppurtunity to rethink my stengths and whether Aerospace was really my passion.
        Again, this was a blessing in disguise as most Uni students do not get the chance to rethink their choices. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After taking a year out to do my software engineering bootcamp, along with attending cognitive based therapy and engaging in heavy reflection - I enrolled on the Computer Science degree.
        I am currently in my 2nd year of study and really enjoying the course. I feel a lot more capable of 
        flourishing after all my experiences in Bristol. After finishing term 1, I found that I really started to enjoy 
        Algorithms II once I began taking the time to try and understand. I am keen on taking the Advanced Algorithms unit 
        in my third year, but I am still keeping an open mind on which modules I would select for next year.

      <p>The Huberman Lab podcast is a useful tool for me as I like to know the best or healthiest way to do something - so I never have to 
        think about how I will approach a certain activity ever again. Likewise with optimising brain function, as Dr. Huberman specialises in Neuroscience at a leading global
        institution I feel he is worth listening to. This episode in particular prompted me to change my weightlifting routine. Within in a few weeks of applying
        these changes, I managed to increase my bench press from 90kg for 8 reps to 100kg for 5 reps.

      <p> This is one of the many good games I have had on chess.com. In this game, I played the Vienna openning. My favourite openning with white 
        is the Vienna Gambit variation but as my rating increased, most players do not fall for the gambit any more. As a result, I have been looking into 
        what GM Daniel Narodistky calls the <a target ="_blank" style = "text-decoration: underline;" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6vYlx-lS6g">Glek System</a>.

    <p>Mach-Hommy is a fascinating artist. He keeps his identity and face hidden from the public, sells the majority of his discography 
      independently, and retains full copyright over his lyrics, so they do not appear online. He raps and sings in Haitian Creole and 
      English. Much of his music is deeply meaningful, and I often find myself adding several books to my reading list after each album 
      release in an effort to better understand his work.

    <p>Billy Woods is a Zimbabwean-American rapper whom I have had the pleasure of seeing perform live twice in the UK. His lyrics are 
      packed with meaning, and his wordplay and vocal range are truly unique. He employs a mix of playful and very dark imagery that 
      reflects his childhood in Zimbabwe as well as the often bleak experiences of African American life. Woods frequently 
      references novels, which often inspires me to add even more books to my reading list.
